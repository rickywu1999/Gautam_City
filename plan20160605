    Which jobs are most crucial?
Core:
-Class to parse, store, and allow for the manipulation of frames
-Class to cartoonify a frame using edge detection and color approximation algorithms

    Which components constitute core functionality vs extras?
Core:
-Class to parse, store, and allow for the manipulation of frames
-Class to cartoonify a frame using edge detection and color approximation algorithms 

Extras:
-an interface that utilizes java processing
-classes that do other things(grayscale, reverse color, ect.)
-upload a video/download changed video

    Which components are prerequisites for others?
All parts can be done separately. 

    Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
-Coding a frame parsing class can be assigned to one person, although the rest of the group member should know how to use this class.
-The cartoonifier class can be delegated to a single person, although it is better to assign it to two people because it may be difficult to implement.
-This is also true for any of the other features that we may decide to put in.

    What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
-Have core functionality complete by 6/12
-Add in extras until deadline
-having a soft deadline at 6/12 means that if we encounter any bugs, we will have plenty of time to fix them
6/5 UPDATE: 
-figure out the algorithm for watershedding images: www.ncc.org.in/download.php?f=NCC2003/C-7.pdf (Do more research)
-need a folder so that the Video library can work on Linux
